# advertising-project

This project was completed as part of the Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp on Udemy. It follows the approach explained by the course instructor, Jose Portilla, and serves as a hands-on application of the concepts learned throughout the bootcamp.

Logistic Regression Project - Solutions
In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

This data set contains the following features:

'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes
'Age': cutomer age in years
'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer
'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet
'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement
'City': City of consumer
'Male': Whether or not consumer was male
'Country': Country of consumer
'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window
'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad

  Project Conclusion: Predicting Ad Clicks Using Logistic Regression
  
In this project, we built a Logistic Regression model to predict whether an internet user would click on an advertisement based on their features. After testing various features and evaluating the modelâ€™s performance, we found that:

The model achieved a high overall accuracy of 93%, meaning it correctly classified most users.
Precision for class 1 (0.94) suggests that when the model predicts a user will click the ad, it is correct 94% of the time.
Recall for class 0 (0.95) indicates that the model effectively identifies users who will not click the ad.
Balanced F1-scores confirm that the model does not favor one class over the other, making it a reliable predictor.
Final Thoughts
With these results, our model can effectively predict whether a user is likely to click on an ad, helping businesses optimize their ad targeting strategies. However, further improvements could be made by testing additional features, tuning hyperparameters, or experimenting with other classification models.
